  <h2>Hi, I'm George Nakhleh</h2> <br>
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
  I'm a junior data scientist in Chicago, working at <a href = "https://www.nm.org/">Northwestern Medicine</a>. <br>
  Interested in how data science can make organizations more responsive to the people they serve<br> 
  ... more on that: how can data science improve and connect CRM + market research <br> 
  Also into: smart cities + civic tech  (super specifically: 311 systems), data ethics, market research of the non-soul-crushing flavor <br><br>
