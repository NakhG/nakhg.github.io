  <h2>Hi, I'm George Nakhleh</h2> <br>
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
  I'm a grad student studying predictive analytics in Chicago, and I do market research at <a href="http://www.knowclick.com/">KnowClick</a> <br>
  Interested in how data science can make organizations more responsive to the people they serve<br> 
  More on that: how can data science improve and connect the fields of CRM + market research, specifically in government (super specifically: 311 systems)<br> Also into: smart cities + civic tech, data ethics, market research of the non-soul-crushing flavor <br><br>
